To test our hypotheses, we developed a quantitative experiment between-subjects, with some within- subject measurements.
We devised 12 study conditions detailed in Table 1 to ensure we could granularly analyze the effect of various PPP
elements on learning outcomes and help fill a gap in the literature pertaining to which PPP elements prove most useful
for learning. As documented in Table 1, participants followed a 10-step protocol which in part required them to respond
to a validated: 1) CS CL component survey (CS CLCS); 2) intrinsic motivation Task Evaluation Questionnaire (TEQ); 3)
Computing Attitudes Survey (CAS).
