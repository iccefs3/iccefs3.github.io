# Prolific Instructions
 
Study 3: Teaching and Learning Computational Thinking
 
We are conducting an academic research experiment about teaching and learning computational thinking (CT).  We ask you to complete a series of activities designed to help us study a variety of ways to learn CT efficiently.  You will be required to answer many questions in conventional survey format across several different survey links.  You will also be required to interact with seven puzzles in an experimental learning system while guided by written instructions.

**In order to use this learning system, which depends upon Adobe Flash, you will need a Windows or Linux operating system with 15 GB of free space so that you can install VMware Workstation Player and open a customized Ubuntu virtual machine image.**  Detailed instructions are within the study.  Please participate only if willing to download and install the software necessary to use the learning system, and if willing to allot dedicated focus time, since some portions of the study involve timed activities.

Your participation is a valuable element of our research and we are grateful for your time and feedback.URL to study guide from Prolific:
