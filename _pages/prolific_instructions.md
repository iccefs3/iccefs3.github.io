## Prolific Survey Link Instructions: Teaching and Learning Computational Thinking

We are conducting an academic research experiment about teaching and learning computational
thinking (CT). We ask you to complete a series of activities designed to help us study a variety of
ways to learn CT efficiently. You will be required to answer many questions in conventional survey
format across several different survey links. You will also be required to interact with four puzzles in
an experimental learning system while guided by written instructions. In order to use this learning
system, your browser will need to run Flash (Chrome is recommended). Your participation is a very
valuable element of our research and we are grateful for your time and feedback.
