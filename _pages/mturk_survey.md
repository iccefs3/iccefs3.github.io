## FS2 Mechanical Turk Survey Link Instructions

We are conducting an academic research experiment about teaching and learning computational thinking (CT). 
We need you to complete a series of activities designed to help us study a variety of ways to learn CT 
efficiently. **Please complete the activity in each of the 10 steps below in order.**  Due to the constraints 
of the experimental design, we cannot approve the work if items are completed out of order, or if the 
incorrect Username is input into any form in the activities linked below.

**Make sure to leave this window open as you complete the activities.** When you are finished, return to this 
page to paste a code that you will find upon completing the final activity into the box below. Once we have 
verified you have completed all items in the series, we will approve payment for your valuable contribution to 
this research.

To complete all activities, you will need to ensure your browser can use Adobe's Flash browser plug-in. If 
you are unsure if your browser has enabled Flash, you can check from this 
[Adobe site](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html). We strongly recommend using Chrome, but other options 
are acceptable as long as the Step 6 puzzles are accessible.

Note that some activities listed below (4, 6, 8) are labeled: 
<span style="color:orange;">*Timed Activity*</span>.  Please attempt to complete these activities without 
interruption.

**Reminder: complete all activities in order using the same Username throughout to receive payment approval.**



1. Visit [https://dev.cu-sage.org/#/reg](https://dev.cu-sage.org/#/reg) and create a new account. Per MTurk's policy, do not enter any personally identifiable information, but make sure to record the Username entered because you will need to enter it throughout the experiment.  The Username is not required to be an email address.
2. Complete this [background survey](https://barnard.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6tANvppcS2uGN9z).
3. Review this [introduction](https://columbia.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c3e0f6de-b46a-4905-b3e3-ac1e007caac9) to the learning system and to the CT concept of Conditionals.
4. Complete the [pre-test](https://barnard.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9vFzI0Sjy587T1z). _Timed Activity_
5. Provide [feedback on the pre-test](https://barnard.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2ttGeiB6RG5QKDb).
6. Login into [https://dev.cu-sage.org/](https://dev.cu-sage.org/), navigate to the assigned Quest, and attempt to complete four puzzles in the learning system. Please do not start the puzzles without first reviewing the instructions labeled _Start Here! |_ _Quest Instructions for All Puzzles_, as those are designed to accompany the puzzles. When you complete a puzzle or the timer expires, navigate to the next puzzle. Proceed to step 7 after you have attempted all four puzzles. _Timed Activity  _ \
**Note: we track interactions with the puzzles and have had to reject many submissions that would have otherwise been accepted had this step been completed.  Please consider skipping this HIT if not intending to attempt to solve the puzzles.**
