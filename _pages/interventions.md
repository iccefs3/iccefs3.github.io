# Intervention
To produce evidence supporting answers to RQ1-2, we organized a 10-step between-subjects study via Mechanical Turk.  The steps involved:
1. creation of a username in the learning system;
1. a background survey;
1. review of a 6-minute video tutorial on the UI and CT concept sequences;
1. a pretest;
1. pretest feedback;
1. familiarization and training varied by condition;
1. training feedback;
1. a posttest;
1. posttest feedback;
1. study feedback.

Further detail on these steps is provided in [Mechanical Turk Survey Link Instructions](/mturk_survey/).

These required responses to the validated CS cognitive load component survey (CS CLCS), to a programming attitude Likert scale survey derived from categorized text-based responses by adults learners in, and to the intrinsic motivation Task Evaluation Questionnaire (TEQ).  In step 6, participants followed written instructions to guide their solving of four puzzles; instructions for the first puzzle included a graphical representation of the correct solution and an explanation of the behavior of each block used for the purpose of familiarization.  Each puzzle auto-submitted upon correct completion or after 500 seconds if the participant had not previously submitted an incorrect solution.  We advised participants to complete steps 4, 6, and 8 without interruption and required completion of all steps within two hours.
We randomly assigned participants to one of three conditions operating as the independent variable: 1) PPP training; 2) PPP with distractors training; 3) training by solving puzzles with access to all blocks and without move correctness or score feedback. The dependent variables included time spent and performance on the pretests and posttests, time spent and block moves made in puzzles, and the cognitive load, programming attitude, and TEQ results.
