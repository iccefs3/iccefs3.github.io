Abstract
======
Using a design thinking approach, we surveyed and interviewed
grade 6-9 teachers on their experience with Scratch and Parsons
Programming Puzzles (PPP). The results lead us to extend Scratch
with gameful PPP functionality focused on individual
computational thinking (CT) concepts. In this paper, we vary
elements of PPPs presented to 624 adult learners to identify those
yielding manageable cognitive load (CL), and maximum CT
motivation and learning efficiency, for a general populace.
Findings indicate PPPs with feedback and without distractors limit
CL, those with feedback produce highest CT motivation, and
those with an isolated block palette and without distractors
produce highest CT learning efficiency. We analyze study data
across nine conditions to offer insight to those developing PPP
systems with the aim to advance equitable CT education for all.
